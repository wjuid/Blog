## gdb Debugging Full Example (Tutorial): ncurses

09 Aug 2016

I'm a little frustrated with finding "gdb examples" online that show  the commands but not their output. gdb is the GNU Debugger, the standard debugger on Linux. I was reminded of the lack of example output when  watching the [Give me 15 minutes and I'll change your view of GDB](http://undo.io/resources/presentations/cppcon-2015-greg-law-give-me-15-minutes-ill-change/) talk by Greg Law at CppCon 2015, which, thankfully, includes output! It's well worth the 15 minutes.

It also inspired me to share a full gdb debugging example, with  output and every step involved, including dead ends. This isn't a  particularly interesting or exotic issue, it's just a routine gdb  debugging session. But it covers the basics and could serve as a  tutorial of sorts, bearing in mind there's a lot more to gdb than I used here.

I'll be running the following commands as root, since I'm debugging a tool that needs root access (for now). Substitute non-root and sudo as  desired. You also aren't expected to read through all this: I've  enumerated each step so you can browse them and find ones of interest.

## 1. The Problem

The [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) collection of BPF tools had a pull request for [cachetop](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/cachetop.py), which uses a top-like display to show page cache statistics by process. Great! However, when I tested it, it hit a segfault:

```
# ./cachetop.py
Segmentation fault
```

Note that it says "Segmentation fault" and not "Segmentation fault  (core dumped)". I'd like a core dump to debug this. (A core dump is a  copy of process memory – the name coming from the era of magnetic core  memory – and can be investigated using a debugger.)

Core dump analysis is one approach for debugging, but not the only  one. I could run the program live in gdb to inspect the issue. I could  also use an external tracer to grab data and stack traces on segfault  events. We'll start with core dumps.

## 2. Fixing Core Dumps

I'll check the core dump settings:

```
# ulimit -c
0
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
core
```

`ulimit -c` shows the maximum size of core dumps created, and it's set to zero: disabling core dumps (for this process and its children).

The `/proc/.../core_pattern` is set to just "core", which will drop a core dump file called "core" in the current directory. That will be ok for now, but I'll show how to set this up for a global location:

```
# ulimit -c unlimited
# mkdir /var/cores
# echo "/var/cores/core.%e.%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```

You can customize that core_pattern further; eg, `%h` for hostname and `%t` for time of dump. The options are documented in the Linux kernel source, under Documentation/sysctl/[kernel.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt).

To make the core_pattern permanent, and survive reboots, you can set it via "kernel.core_pattern" in /etc/sysctl.conf.

Trying again:

```
# ./cachetop.py
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# ls -lh /var/cores
total 19M
-rw------- 1 root root 20M Aug  7 22:15 core.python.30520
# file /var/cores/core.python.30520 
/var/cores/core.python.30520: ELF 64-bit LSB core file x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style, from 'python ./cachetop.py'
```

That's better: we have our core dump.

## 3. Starting GDB

Now I'll run gdb with the target program location (using shell  substitution, "`", although you should specify the full path unless  you're sure that will work), and the core dump file:

```
# gdb `which python` /var/cores/core.python.30520

#0  0x00007f0a37aac40d in doupdate () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5
```

The last two lines are especially interesting: it tells us it's a segmentation fault in the `doupdate()` function from the libncursesw library. That's worth a quick web search  in case it's a well-known issue. I took a quick look but didn't find a  single common cause.

I already can guess what libncursesw is for, but if that were foreign to you, then being under "/lib" and ending in ".so.*" shows it's a  shared library, which might have a man page, website, package  description, etc.

```
# dpkg -l | grep libncursesw
ii  libncursesw5:amd64                  6.0+20160213-1ubuntu1                    amd64
     shared libraries for terminal handling (wide character support)
```

I happen to be debugging this on Ubuntu, but the Linux distro shouldn't matter for gdb usage.

## 4. Back Trace

Stack back traces show how we arrived at the point of fail, and are  often enough to help identify a common problem. It's usually the first  command I use in a gdb session: `bt` (short for `backtrace`):

```
(gdb) bt

```

Read from bottom up, to go from parent to child. The "`??`"  entries are where symbol translation failed. Stack walking – which  produces the stack trace – can also fail. In that case you'll likely see a single valid frame, then a small number of bogus addresses. If  symbols or stacks are too badly broken to make sense of the stack trace, then there are usually ways to fix it: installing debug info packages  (giving gdb more symbols, and letting it do DWARF-based stack walks), or recompiling the software from source with frame pointers and debugging  information (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer -g`). Many of the above "`??`" entries can be fixed by adding the python-dbg package.

This particular stack doesn't look very helpful: frames 5 to 17  (indexed on the left) are Python internals, although we can't see the  Python methods (yet). Then frame 4 is the _curses library, then we're in libncursesw. Looks like `wgetch()`->`wrefresh()`->`doupdate()`. Just based on the names, I'd guess a window refresh. Why would that core dump?

## 5. Disassembly

I'll start by disassembling the function we segfaulted in, `doupdate()`:

```
(gdb) disas doupdate
Dump of assembler code for function doupdate:
   0x00007f0a37aac2e0 <+0>:   push   %r15

   0x00007f0a37aac423 <+323>: mov    %rax,0x40(%rsp)
[...]
```

Output truncated. (I could also have just typed "`disas`" and it would have defaulted to `doupdate`.)

The arrow "=>" is pointing to our segfault address, which is doing a `mov 0x10(%rsi),%rdi`: a move from the memory pointed to in the %rsi register plus an offset  of 0x10, to the %rdi register. I'll check the state of the registers  next.

## 6. Check Registers

Printing register state using `i r` (short for `info registers`):

```
(gdb) i r
rax            0x0  0
rbx            0x1993060    26816608

r12            0x0  0
r13            0x0  0
r14            0x7f0a3848eb10   139681870703376
r15            0x19ce7d0    27060176
rip            0x7f0a37aac40d   0x7f0a37aac40d <doupdate+301>
eflags         0x10246  [ PF ZF IF RF ]
cs             0x33 51
ss             0x2b 43
ds             0x0  0
es             0x0  0
fs             0x0  0
gs             0x0  0
```

Well, %rsi is zero. There's our problem! Zero is unlikely a valid  address, and this type of segfault is a common software bug:  dereferencing an uninitialized or NULL pointer.

## 7. Memory Mappings

You can double check if zero is valid using `i proc m` (short for `info proc mappings`):

```
(gdb) i proc m
Mapped address spaces:

      Start Addr           End Addr       Size     Offset objfile
        0x400000           0x6e7000   0x2e7000        0x0 /usr/bin/python2.7

[...]
```

The first valid virtual address is 0x400000. Anything below that is  invalid, and if referenced, will trigger a segmentation fault.

At this point there are several different ways to dig further. I'll start with some instruction stepping.

## 8. Breakpoints

Back to the disassembly:

```
   0x00007f0a37aac401 <+289>:   mov    0x20cb68(%rip),%rax        # 0x7f0a37cb8f70
   0x00007f0a37aac408 <+296>:   mov    (%rax),%rsi
   0x00007f0a37aac40b <+299>:   xor    %eax,%eax
=> 0x00007f0a37aac40d <+301>:   mov    0x10(%rsi),%rdi
```

Reading these four instructions: it looks like it's pulling something from the stack into %rax, then dereferencing %rax into %rsi, the  setting %eax to zero (the xor is an optimization, instead of doing a mov of $0), and then we dereference %rsi with an offset, although we know  %rsi is zero. This sequence is for walking data structures. Maybe %rax  would be interesting, but it's been set to zero by the prior  instruction, so we can't see it in the core dump register state.

I can set a breakpoint on doupdate+289, then single-step through each instruction to see how the registers are set and change. First, I need  to launch gdb so that we're executing the program live:

```
# gdb `which python`
GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.04) 7.11.1

For help, type "help".
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...
Reading symbols from /usr/bin/python...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
```

Now to set the breakpoint using `b` (short for `break`):

```
(gdb) b *doupdate + 289
No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
```

Oops. I wanted to show this error to explain why we often start out with a breakpoint on `main`, at which point the symbols are likely loaded, and then setting the real breakpoint of interest. I'll go straight to `doupdate` function entry, run the problem, then set the offset breakpoint once it hits the function:

```
(gdb) b doupdate
Function "doupdate" not defined.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
Breakpoint 1 (doupdate) pending.
(gdb) r cachetop.py

Breakpoint 1, 0x00007ffff34ad2e0 in doupdate () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5
(gdb) b *doupdate + 289
Breakpoint 2 at 0x7ffff34ad401
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, 0x00007ffff34ad401 in doupdate () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5
```

We've arrived at our breakpoint.

If you haven't done this before, the `r` (`run`)  command takes arguments that will be passed to the gdb target we  specified earlier on the command line (python). So this ends up running  "python cachetop.py".

## 9. Stepping

I'll step one instruction (`si`, short for `stepi`) then inspect registers:

```
(gdb) si
0x00007ffff34ad408 in doupdate () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5

gs             0x0  0
(gdb) p/a 0x7ffff3e8f948
$1 = 0x7ffff3e8f948 <cur_term>
```

Another clue. So the NULL pointer we're dereferencing looks like it's in a symbol called "`cur_term`" (`p/a` is short for `print/a`, where "`/a`" means format as an address). Given this is ncurses, is our TERM environment set to something odd?

```
# echo $TERM
xterm-256color
```

I tried setting that to vt100 and running the program, but it hit the same segfault.

Note that I've inspected just the first invocation of `doupdate()`, but it could be called multiple times, and the issue may be a later invocation. I can step through each by running `c` (short for `continue`). That will be ok if it's only called a few times, but if it's called a  few thousand times I'll want a different approach. (I'll get back to  this in section 15.)

## 10. Reverse Stepping

gdb has a great feature called reverse stepping, which Greg Law included in his talk. Here's an example.

I'll start a python session again, to show this from the beginning:

```
# gdb `which python`

Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...
Reading symbols from /usr/bin/python...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
```

Now I'll set a breakpoint on `doupdate` as before, but once  it's hit, I'll enable recording, then continue the program and let it  crash. Recording adds considerable overhead, so I don't want to add it  on `main`.

```
(gdb) b doupdate

Breakpoint 1 (doupdate) pending.

Continuing.

0x00007ffff34ad40d in doupdate () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5
```

At this point I can reverse-step through lines or instructions. It  works by playing back register state from our recording. I'll move back  in time two instructions, then print registers:

```
(gdb) reverse-stepi

```

So, back to finding the "cur_term" clue. I really want to read the source code at this point, but I'll start with debug info.

## 11. Debug Info

This is libncursesw, and I don't have debug info installed (Ubuntu):

```
# apt-cache search libncursesw
libncursesw5 - shared libraries for terminal handling (wide character support)
libncursesw5-dbg - debugging/profiling libraries for ncursesw
libncursesw5-dev - developer's libraries for ncursesw

```

I'll add that:

```

```

Good, those versions match. So how does our segfault look now?

```

The stack trace looks a bit different: we aren't really in `doupdate()`, but `ClrBlank()`, which has been inlined in `ClrUpdate()`, and inlined in `doupdate()`.

Now I really want to see source.

## 12. Source Code

With the debug info package installed, gdb can list the source along with the assembly:

```
(gdb) disas/s

   0x00007f0a37aac415 <+309>: jne    0x7f0a37aac6f7 <doupdate+1047>
```

Great! See the arrow "=>" and the line of code above it. So we're segfaulting on "`if (back_color_erase)`"? That doesn't seem possible. (A segfault would be due to a memory dereference, which in C would be `a->b` or `*a`, but in this case it's just "`back_color_erase`", which looks like it's accessing an ordinary variable and not dereferencing memory.)

At this point I double checked that I had the right debug info  version, and re-ran the application to segfault it in a live gdb  session. Same place.

Is there something special about `back_color_erase`? We're in `ClrBlank()`, so I'll list that source code:

```
(gdb) list ClrBlank
1124    
1125    static NCURSES_INLINE NCURSES_CH_T
1126    ClrBlank(NCURSES_SP_DCLx WINDOW *win)
1127    {
1128        NCURSES_CH_T blank = blankchar;
1129        if (back_color_erase)
1130        AddAttr(blank, (AttrOf(BCE_BKGD(SP_PARM, win)) & BCE_ATTRS));
1131        return blank;
1132    }
1133    
```

Ah, that's not defined in the function, so it's a global?

## 13. TUI

It's worth showing how this looks in the gdb text user interface  (TUI), which I haven't used that much but was inspired after seeing  Greg's talk.

You can launch it using `--tui`:

```

It's complaining about no Python source. I could fix that, but we're  crashing in libncursesw. Hitting enter lets it finish loading, at which  point it loads the libncursesw debug info source code:

Awesome!

The arrow ">" shows the line of code that we crashed in. It gets even better: with the `layout split` command we can follow the source with the disassembly in separate windows:

Greg demonstrated this with reverse stepping, so you can imagine  following both code and assembly execution at the same time (I'd need a  video to demonstrate that here).

## 14. External: cscope

I still want to learn more about `back_color_erase`, and I could try gdb's `search` command, but I've found I'm quicker using an external tool: cscope.  cscope is a text-based source code browser from Bell Labs in the 1980's. If you have a modern IDE that you prefer, use that instead.

Setting up cscope:

```
# apt-get install -y cscope
# wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/ncurses/ncurses_6.0+20160213.orig.tar.gz
# tar xvf ncurses_6.0+20160213.orig.tar.gz
# cd ncurses-6.0-20160213
# cscope -bqR
# cscope -dq
```

`cscope -bqR` builds the lookup database. `cscope -dq` then launches cscope.

Searching for `back_color_erase` definition:

```
Cscope version 15.8b                                   Press the ? key for help












Find this C symbol:
Find this global definition: back_color_erase

```

Hitting enter:

```
[...]
#define non_dest_scroll_region         CUR Booleans[26]
#define can_change                     CUR Booleans[27]
#define back_color_erase               CUR Booleans[28]
#define hue_lightness_saturation       CUR Booleans[29]
#define col_addr_glitch                CUR Booleans[30]
#define cr_cancels_micro_mode          CUR Booleans[31]
[...]
```

Oh, a `#define`. (They could have at least capitalized it, as is a common style with `#define`'s.)

Ok, so what's `CUR`? Looking up definitions in cscope is a breeze.

```
#define CUR cur_term->type.                                                     
```

At least that `#define` is capitalized!

We'd found `cur_term` earlier, by stepping instructions and examining registers. What is it?

```
#if 0 && !0
extern NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR(TERMINAL *) cur_term;
#elif 0
NCURSES_WRAPPED_VAR(TERMINAL *, cur_term);
#define cur_term   NCURSES_PUBLIC_VAR(cur_term())
#else
extern NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR(TERMINAL *) cur_term;
#endif
```

cscope read /usr/include/term.h for this. So, more macros. I had to  highlight in bold the line of code I think is taking effect there. Why  is there an "`if 0 && !0 ... elif 0`"? I don't know (I'd need to read more source). Sometimes programmers use "`#if 0`" around debug code they want to disable in production, however, this looks auto-generated.

Searching for `NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR` finds:

```
#  define NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR(type) NCURSES_IMPEXP type
```

... and `NCURSES_IMPEXP`:

```
/* Take care of non-cygwin platforms */
#if !defined(NCURSES_IMPEXP)          
#  define NCURSES_IMPEXP /* nothing */
#endif                                
#if !defined(NCURSES_API)             
#  define NCURSES_API /* nothing */   
#endif                                
#if !defined(NCURSES_EXPORT)          
#  define NCURSES_EXPORT(type) NCURSES_IMPEXP type NCURSES_API
#endif                                
#if !defined(NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR)      
#  define NCURSES_EXPORT_VAR(type) NCURSES_IMPEXP type
#endif  
```

... and `TERMINAL` was:

```
typedef struct term {       /* describe an actual terminal */
    TERMTYPE    type;       /* terminal type description */
    short   Filedes;    /* file description being written to */
    TTY     Ottyb,      /* original state of the terminal */
        Nttyb;      /* current state of the terminal */
    int     _baudrate;  /* used to compute padding */
    char *      _termname;      /* used for termname() */
} TERMINAL;
```

Gah! Now `TERMINAL` is capitalized. Along with the macros, this code is not that easy to follow...

Ok, who actually sets `cur_term`? Remember our problem is that it's set to zero, maybe because it's uninitialized or explicitly set.  Browsing the code paths that set it might provide more clues, to help  answer why it isn't being set, or why it is set to zero. Using the first option in cscope:

```
Find this C symbol: cur_term
Find this global definition:
Find functions called by this function:
Find functions calling this function:
[...]
```

And browsing the entries quickly finds:

```
NCURSES_EXPORT(TERMINAL *)
NCURSES_SP_NAME(set_curterm) (NCURSES_SP_DCLx TERMINAL * termp)
{
    TERMINAL *oldterm;

    T((T_CALLED("set_curterm(%p)"), (void *) termp));

    _nc_lock_global(curses);
    oldterm = cur_term;
    if (SP_PARM)
    SP_PARM->_term = termp;
#if USE_REENTRANT
    CurTerm = termp;
#else
    cur_term = termp;
#endif
```

I added the highlighting. Even the function name is wrapped in a macro. But at least we've found how `cur_term` is set: via `set_curterm()`. Maybe that isn't being called?

## 15. External: perf-tools/ftrace/uprobes

I'll cover using gdb for this in a moment, but I can't help trying the uprobe tool from my [perf-tools](https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools) collection, which uses Linux ftrace and uprobes. One advantage of using tracers is that they don't pause the target process, like gdb does  (although that doesn't matter for this cachetop.py example). Another  advantage is that I can trace a few events or a few thousand just as  easily.

I should be able to trace calls to `set_curterm()` in libncursesw, and even print the first argument:

```
# /apps/perf-tools/bin/uprobe 'p:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5:set_curterm %di'
ERROR: missing symbol "set_curterm" in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5
```

Well, that didn't work. Where is `set_curterm()`? There are lots of ways to find it, like gdb or objdump:

```
(gdb) info symbol set_curterm
set_curterm in section .text of /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5

# objdump -tT /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libncursesw.so.5 | grep cur_term
0000000000000000      DO *UND*  0000000000000000  NCURSES_TINFO_5.0.19991023 cur_term
# objdump -tT /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 | grep cur_term
0000000000228948 g    DO .bss   0000000000000008  NCURSES_TINFO_5.0.19991023 cur_term
```

gdb works better. Plus if I took a closer look at the source, I would have noticed it was building it for libtinfo.

Trying to trace `set_curterm()` in libtinfo:

```
# /apps/perf-tools/bin/uprobe 'p:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5:set_curterm %di'
Tracing uprobe set_curterm (p:set_curterm /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5:0xfa80 %di). Ctrl-C to end.
          python-31617 [007] d... 24236402.719959: set_curterm: (0x7f116fcc2a80) arg1=0x1345d70
          python-31617 [007] d... 24236402.720033: set_curterm: (0x7f116fcc2a80) arg1=0x13a22e0
          python-31617 [007] d... 24236402.723804: set_curterm: (0x7f116fcc2a80) arg1=0x14cdfa0
          python-31617 [007] d... 24236402.723838: set_curterm: (0x7f116fcc2a80) arg1=0x0
^C
```

That works. So `set_curterm()` *is* called, and has been called four times. The last time it was passed zero, which sounds like it could be the problem.

If you're wondering how I knew the %di register was the first  argument, then it comes from the AMD64/x86_64 ABI (and the assumption  that this compiled library is ABI compliant). Here's a reminder:

```

I'd also like to see a stack trace for arg1=0x0 invocation, but this ftrace tool doesn't support stack traces yet.

## 16. External: bcc/BPF

Since we're debugging a bcc tool, cachetop.py, it's worth noting that bcc's trace.py has capabilities like my older uprobe tool:

```
# ./trace.py 'p:tinfo:set_curterm "%d", arg1'
TIME     PID    COMM         FUNC             -
01:00:20 31698  python       set_curterm      38018416
01:00:20 31698  python       set_curterm      38396640
01:00:20 31698  python       set_curterm      39624608
01:00:20 31698  python       set_curterm      0
```

Yes, we're using bcc to debug bcc!

If you are new to [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc),  it's worth checking it out. It provides Python and lua interfaces for  the new BPF tracing features that are in the Linux 4.x series. In short, it allows lots of performance tools that were previously impossible or  prohibitively expensive to run. I've posted instructions for running it  on [Ubuntu Xenial](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-06-14/ubuntu-xenial-bcc-bpf.html).

The bcc trace.py tool should have a switch for printing user stack  traces, since the kernel now has BPF stack capabilities as of Linux 4.6, although at the time of writing we haven't added this switch yet.

## 17. More Breakpoints

I should really have used gdb breakpoints on `set_curterm()` to start with, but I hope that was an interesting detour through ftrace and BPF.

Back to live running mode:

```
# gdb `which python`

80  {
```

Ok, at this breakpoint we can see that `set_curterm()` is  being invoked with a termp=0x0 argument, thanks to debuginfo for that  information. If I didn't have debuginfo, I could just print the  registers on each breakpoint.

I'll print the stack trace so that we can see *who* was setting `curterm` to 0.

```

Ok, more clues...I think. We're in `llvm::sys::Process::FileDescriptorHasColors()`. The llvm compiler?

## 18. External: cscope, take 2

More source code browsing using cscope, this time in llvm. The FileDescriptorHasColors() function has:

```
static bool terminalHasColors(int fd) {
[...]
  // Now extract the structure allocated by setupterm and free its memory
  // through a really silly dance.
  struct term *termp = set_curterm((struct term *)nullptr);
  (void)del_curterm(termp); // Drop any errors here.
```

Here's what that code used to be in an earlier version:

```
static bool terminalHasColors() {
  if (const char *term = std::getenv("TERM")) {
    // Most modern terminals support ANSI escape sequences for colors.
    // We could check terminfo, or have a list of known terms that support
    // colors, but that would be overkill.
    // The user can always ask for no colors by setting TERM to dumb, or
    // using a commandline flag.
    return strcmp(term, "dumb") != 0;
  }
  return false;
}
```

It [became](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/d485e7bd7639cd6b39c6113a30fbc3cdc8c41c4c#diff-a4fb6575a290937bc9142e3d7efc8989) a "silly dance" involving calling `set_curterm()` with a null pointer.

## 19. Writing Memory

As an experiment and to explore a possible workaround, I'll modify memory of the running process to avoid the `set_curterm()` of zero.

I'll run gdb, set a breakpoint on `set_curterm()`, and take it to the zero invocation:

```
# gdb `which python`
GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.04) 7.11.1                                  
[...]
(gdb) b set_curterm
Function "set_curterm" not defined.

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=termp@entry=0xbecb90) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80
80      {
(gdb) c

80      { 
```

At this point I'll use the `set` command to overwrite memory and replace zero with the previous argument of `set_curterm()`, 0xbecb90, seen above, on the hope that it's still valid.

**WARNING: Writing memory is not safe!** gdb won't ask "are you  sure?". If you get it wrong or make a typo, you will corrupt the  application. Best case, your application crashes immediately, and you  realize your mistake. Worst case, your application continues with  silently corrupted data that is only discovered years later.

In this case, I'm experimenting on a lab machine with no production  data, so I'll continue. I'll print the value of the %rdi register as hex (`p/x`), then `set` it to the previous address, print it again, then print all registers:

```
(gdb) p/x $rdi
$1 = 0x0
(gdb) set $rdi=0xbecb90
(gdb) p/x $rdi
$2 = 0xbecb90
(gdb) i r

fs             0x0  0
gs             0x0  0
```

(Since at this point I have debug info installed, I don't need to refer to registers in this case, I could have called `set` on "`termp`", the variable name argument to `set_curterm()`, instead of `$rdi`.)

%rdi is now populated, so those registers look ok to continue.

```
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=termp@entry=0x0) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80
80  {
```

Ok, we survived a call to `set_curterm()`! However, we've hit another, also with an argument of zero. Trying our write trick again:

```
(gdb) set $rdi=0xbecb90
(gdb) c
Continuing.
warning: JITed object file architecture unknown is not compatible with target architecture i386:x86-64.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

1129        if (back_color_erase)
```

Ahhh. That's what I get for writing memory. So this experiment ended in another segfault.

## 20. Conditional Breakpoints

In the previous section, I had to use three continues to reach the  right invocation of a breakpoint. If that were hundreds of invocations,  then I'd use a conditional breakpoint. Here's an example.

I'll run the program and break on `set_curterm()` as usual:

```
# gdb `which python`
GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.04) 7.11.1                                  
[...]
(gdb) b set_curterm
Function "set_curterm" not defined.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
Breakpoint 1 (set_curterm) pending.
(gdb) r cachetop.py
Starting program: /usr/bin/python cachetop.py
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=termp@entry=0xa43150) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80
80  {
```

Now I'll turn breakpoint 1 into a conditional breakpoint, so that it only fires when the %rdi register is zero:

```
(gdb) cond 1 $rdi==0x0
(gdb) i b
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00007ffff3c76a80 in set_curterm at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80
    stop only if $rdi==0x0
    breakpoint already hit 1 time
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=0x0) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80
(gdb)
```

Neat! `cond` is short for `conditional`. So why didn't I run it right away, when I first created the "pending" breakpoint? I've  found conditionals don't work on pending breakpoints, at least on this  gdb version. (Either that or I'm doing it wrong.) I also used `i b` here (`info breakpoints`) to list them with information.

## 21. Returns

I did try another write-like hack, but this time changing the instruction path rather than the data.

**WARNING: see previous warning**, which also applies here.

I'll take us to the `set_curterm()` 0x0 breakpoint as before, and then issue a `ret` (short for `return`), which will return from the function immediately and not execute it. My  hope is that by not executing it, it won't set the global `curterm` to 0x0.

```
[...]
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=0x0) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80

(gdb) ret

#0  0x00007ffff5a44e75 in llvm::sys::Process::FileDescriptorHasColors(int) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbcc.so.0
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
                                                    _nc_free_termtype (ptr=ptr@entry=0x100) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/free_ttype.c:52
52      FreeIfNeeded(ptr->str_table);
```

Another crash. Again, that's what I get for messing in this way.

One more try. After browsing the code a bit more, I want to try doing a `ret` twice, in case the parent function is also involved. Again, this is just a hacky experiment:

```
[...]
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, set_curterm (termp=0x0) at /build/ncurses-pKZ1BN/ncurses-6.0+20160213/ncurses/tinfo/lib_cur_term.c:80

(gdb) c
```

The screen goes blank and pauses...then redraws:

```

Wow! It's working!

## 22. A Better Workaround

I'd been posting debugging output to [github](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/615), especially since the lead BPF engineer, Alexei Starovoitov, is also  well versed in llvm internals, and the root cause seemed to be a bug in  llvm. While I was messing with writes and returns, he suggested adding  the llvm option `-fno-color-diagnostics` to bcc, to avoid this  problem code path. It worked! It was added to bcc as a workaround. (And  we should get that llvm bug fixed.)

## 23. Python Context

At this point we've fixed the problem, but you might be curious to see the stack trace fully fixed.

Adding python-dbg:

```
# apt-get install -y python-dbg

[...]
The following additional packages will be installed:
  libpython-dbg libpython2.7-dbg python2.7-dbg

The following NEW packages will be installed:

Now I'll rerun gdb and view the stack trace:

No more "`??`"'s, but not hugely more helpful, yet.

The python debug packages have added other capabilities to gdb. Now we can look at the python backtrace:

```
(gdb) py-bt

... and Python source list:

It's identifying where in our Python code we were executing that hit the segfault. That's really nice!

The problem with the initial stack trace is that we're seeing Python  internals that are executing the methods, but not the methods  themselves. If you're debugging another language, it's up to its  complier/runtime how it ends up executing code. If you do a web search  for "*language name*" and "gdb" you might find it has gdb  debugging extensions like Python does. If it doesn't, the bad news is  you'll need to write your own. The good news is that this is even  possible! Search for documentation on "adding new GDB commands in  Python", as they can be written in Python.

## 24. And More

While it might look like I've written comprehensive tour of gdb, I really haven't: there's a lot more to gdb. The `help` command will list the major sections:

```
(gdb) help
List of classes of commands:

aliases -- Aliases of other commands
breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points
data -- Examining data
files -- Specifying and examining files
internals -- Maintenance commands
obscure -- Obscure features
running -- Running the program
stack -- Examining the stack
status -- Status inquiries
support -- Support facilities
tracepoints -- Tracing of program execution without stopping the program
user-defined -- User-defined commands

Type "help" followed by a class name for a list of commands in that class.
Type "help all" for the list of all commands.
Type "help" followed by command name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
```

You can then run `help` on each command class. For example, here's the full listing for breakpoints:

```
(gdb) help breakpoints
Making program stop at certain points.

Type "help" followed by command name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
```

This helps to illustrate how many capabilities gdb has, and how few I needed to use in this example.

## 25. Final Words

Well, that was kind of a nasty issue: an LLVM bug breaking ncurses  and causing a Python program to segfault. But the commands and  procedures I used to debug it were mostly routine: viewing stack traces, checking registers, setting breakpoints, stepping, and browsing source. 

When I first used gdb (years ago), I really didn't like it. It felt  clumsy and limited. gdb has improved a lot since then, as have my gdb  skills, and I now see it as a powerful modern debugger. Feature sets  vary between debuggers, but gdb may be the most powerful text-based  debugger nowadays, with lldb catching up.

I hope anyone searching for gdb examples finds the full output I've  shared to be useful, as well as the various caveats I discussed along  the way. Maybe I'll post some more gdb sessions when I get a chance,  especially for other runtimes like Java.

It's `q` to quit gdb.
